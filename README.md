# sparky-logic
A repository for binary, logic, circuits, and more.

Currently contains files for a binary conversion web applet, testable at https://output.jsbin.com/nelepu/.

If you have downloaded a release, in order to access the binary conversion web applet, open the "index.html" file in the "conversions" folder. This should open in your default browser.
